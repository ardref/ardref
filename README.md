- 👋 Hi, I’m @ardref

My name is Richard Prosser and I am retired/widowed now.
Getting bored and looking for something to do.
I've decided to tackle software again, after a three-year break.


- 👀 I’m interested in ...

Python in particular, and I am also interested in Pyramid/Kotti (CMS).


- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

Docker 

Kotti

My first Docker image is cd45/kotti. Just point a browser to 127.0.0.1:5000, once the container is running.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

I own the domain NewsTube.com, which I intend to be an "Open Content" non-profit media platform.
**I wish to transfer ownership of this domain to a trust of some kind**, free of charge.
Part of my will in fact, which needs updating.

The purpose of NewsTube is to provide a genuine alternative to corporate media giants, a kind
of truly "democratic newspaper", which I had envisaged long before the Internet was born.

This may sound corny but "By The People, Of The People, For The People" could be the masthead, even though
I am not American. We have severe challenges to Democracy here in the UK as well as elsewhere, so this my
attempt to combat the drift towards a Brave New World.

I intend such a trust to operate along 'Social Enterprise' lines, with Mondrian being a good example I believe.
The Independent Publishers who will be providing most of the content should probably have a say in the site's operation.

They can expect to receive more money for their efforts than they could get elsewhere, as profit is not such an issue.
Ongoing investment will be required however, as the demand increases. 

ABSOLUTELY NO ADVERTISING! Except perhaps for the "local classified" type. Where there is money, there is muck.
We need to be careful about that, please. All funding via subscription, I guess.

Management of the site will be required, which includes moderation of content sometimes.
I am hoping that users will raise the alarm about any contentious issues.

@Panquake is very relevant, and I hope to make use of their Blockchain "Proof of Authority" OS code in due course.
A distributed network may also be required.
See https://youtu.be/SuedlVz1A7s for further details.


Further details on request, if anyone is interested.
